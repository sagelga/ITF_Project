# Alert: This project will be discontinued. Feel free to look around.
# Introduction

This project was made by a small group of colleagues in Faculty of Information Technology KMITL.

The goal of this website is to give the user's the experience of photo hosting and social media at the same time.

Due to the limited times and resources of clever teammates, this website is partially working. Mostly to the static website.

# Motivation

The motivational website is from Flickr and some other website.

Our difference is to do something different and deliver easier and more clear interface, based on Toolbar.

# License

The code is normally copyright by my team. You may clone the repository as long as it was non-competitive or non-profit purposes.

# Resources

We uses Boostrap (v. 3.3.7) and some extensions of CSS on the Internet. Open-sourced.

Some of the codes are shared freely by multiple websites. We adapted it, and we make it better.

Most of the website alignments are inspired by the famous website around the world. And we appreciate that resources.

# Code Example
Code examples are in the picture. Looked pretty cool, right?
